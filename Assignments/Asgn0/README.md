Git, Java, Android, and Eclipse Setup for CS Students:
------------------------------------------------------

Many of these steps may require you to do your own independent research on how to complete them. For example, if you don't know how to add a command to your path, you will need to Google it. If you don't know how to clone a Git repo, you will need to Google it. 

Due: Monday at 11:59pm

1.	Download and install Git: http://git-scm.com/downloads -- Windows users MUST setup the Git Bash Shell
2.	Create a GitHub account here: https://github.com/
3.	Create a public Git repository and send the HTTPS clone URL to the TA in an email  (TA email address: lauren.e.buck.1@vanderbilt.edu).
    -  Your email subject should be EXACTLY: “CSX278 GitHub Repo”
    -  Make sure and put your name and preferred email address in the email
4.	(Google or look at the week 2 Git reading if you are unsure of how to complete steps 5-9)
5.	You must use the Git command line and not a Gui interface for this course
6.	Clone the course repository from: https://github.com/juleswhite/CSX278
7.	Clone your own newly created repo
8.	Add a new folder named “Solutions/Asgn0” to your repo and a README.md file to the "Solutions/Asgn0" folder
9.	Commit your new folder and README file 
10.	Create a new “dev” branch in your repo, set it up as a tracking branch, and push the branch to the server so that you can see it in the list of branches in GitHub 
11.	Download and install Eclipse Standard (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) and the Java 8 JDK (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
    -  You do NOT need Netbeans
12.	Download and install Android Studio
13.	Download and install Gradle from: https://gradle.org/ and add it to your path (you should be able to type "gradle" on the command line)
14.	Make sure you know how to use a terminal or the Git Bash Shell to do basic Unix commands by about the 3rd week of class, roughly equivalent knowledge to tutorials One-Four up to wildcards: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/

# Estimation

In these exercises, you will practice writing requirements. Writing a clear requirement 
specification is one of the most difficult challenges in software engineering. It is 
almost inevitable that requirements are misunderstood and that wrong assumptions are made.
These exercises will give you an appreciation of how hard requirements are so that you 
approach them with the appropriate respect. The most important thing to understand about
requirements is that you don't understand them even when you think you do. Ask questions. 

## The Waterfall Drawing Game

Each team has been provided with a picture. You must keep this picture secret and not show it
to any other teams. The goal of the game is to provide written instructions to another team
on how to draw the same picture. Your instructions cannot include any diagrams and must be 
purely textual.

  1. You have 5 minutes to create your instructions
  2. You will pass your instructions to another team (keep your original image folded in half and hidden)
  3. You will have 3 minutes to draw a picture based on the other team's instructions
  4. You are not allowed to ask other teams any questions or provide them any feedback on their drawing
  5. You will then pass your completed drawing to the instructor or TA 
  6. You will then pass your instructions to another team
  7. This process will continue until each team has drawn a picture based on all other teams' instructions

## The Agile Drawing Game

This game will proceed similarly to the last one. However, this game modifies the rules in the following
ways:

  1. Exchange pictures with the team from the previous iteration
  2. You have 5 minutes to create your instructions
  3. You will exchange instructions with another team other than the team that you worked with in the first exercise
  4. One team will draw a picture based on the instructions while the other team watches
  5. Before the round begins, the drawing team has 2 minutes to ask any questions that they would like
  6. At the 2 minute mark, drawing will be paused and the drawing team has another 1 minute to ask any questions
  7. The drawing team will have another 2 minutes to draw
  8. The drawing will then be paused again to answer another 2 minutes of questions
  9. The drawing team will then complete the drawing
  8. The teams will switch roles and repeat the process

## The Interface Drawing Game

Make sure that one of your user story cards has a list of all team members on the back. Also, make sure that at least one page from your drawings has all team members names on the back.

As a team, you should decide on an application that you would like to have and would be useful to Vanderbilt students, college students in general, or people living in Nashville. You must then write a specification for the application and deliver the specification as a set of user stories. Each user story must be something that would impact the end-user (e.g., no implementation style user stories). The user stories should be written on the sticky notes provided to you in class. You will have 5 minutes to create your user stories. 

For each user story, you must create an "acceptance criteria" or method for evaluating if the user story is satisfied by an implementation of the specification. Your acceptance criteria should be "testable" by a person on another team. Your acceptance criteria should be written down on one copy of each user story.

Exchange user stories with another team and draw a user interface to implement the stories that they listed. You have 10 minutes to complete your drawing.

When you are done, exchange user stories and drawings with another team. For each user story, mark whether or not the story was completed based on the stated acceptance criteria on the card. You will have 5 minutes to complete this task. We will then tally the scores. 

All user stories and drawings should be turned in for grading at the end of class.

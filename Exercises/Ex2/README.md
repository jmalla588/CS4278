# Estimation Games

If describing requirements is hard, estimating them is even harder. The 
inherent ambiguity in requirements make accurate estimation difficult. 
Further, it can be extremely difficult to predict the consequences of
important design decisions, which makes scheduling even worse. These
games will help to reinforce the difficulty of estimation in software
engineering.

## The Throw Things Game

You have been asked to throw the following items 1 meter:

  1. Stone
  2. Jaguar
  3. Feather
  4. Flour
  5. House
  6. Sheet of Paper
  7. Pipe
  8. Milky Way
  9. Carpet
  10. Grass

As a group, select one person to be the moderator. 

  1. The moderator should read off one of the items on the list and give everyone a 
     chance to write down how difficult they think it will be to throw the item
     1 meter on a scale of 1-10 (10 is the hardest). 
  2. When everyone has written down their answer, everyone should turn over their 
     answers.
  3. The team members with the lowest and highest difficulties listed should discuss their answers.
  4. The team should agree on a final difficulty.
  5. After each item is estimated, it should be put in the list of estimated items and sorted according to difficulty.
  6. You can ask questions, but they must be written down and handed to instructor
  7. You will have 10 minutes to complete the estimation

## Estimation Matching

Each team should write a set of requirements for an application that would help Vanderbilt students. 
After finishing your requirements, assume that you are starting work on the project today. Create a
schedule for when each requirement will be completed. You have 10 minutes to complete this task.
Make sure that your schedule and estimates are not on the same paper that your requirements are on.

The UNIV students in each group should take the group's requirements to another team and ask them to
provide an estimate of how long each requirement will take. UNIV students should NOT discuss any of the
prior estimates or schedules that were generated. As the estimates are being generated, the UNIV students 
should use a fresh sheet of paper to create a schedule for the project based on the new team's estimates.
You have 5 minutes to discuss the requirements and generate the schedule.

When you are done, the UNIV students should take the requirements to a new team and repeat the process.

When you have finished creating the schedules with the other teams, return to your original team.

Using the schedules that were produced:

1. Determine the latest completion date produced by any team for each requirement
2. Determine the number of days between the latest completion date for each requirement and
   your estimated completion date for the requirement (if it was your estimate, record 0)
3. Assume that the later dates are correct
4. Calculate how many days late your project was delivered
5. Determine the earliest completion date produced by any team for each requirement
6. Assume that the earlier dates are correct
7. Determine the number of days between the earliest completion date for each requirement and
   your estimated completion date for the requirement (if it was your estimate, record 0)
8. Calculate how many days early your project was delivered
9. Your score is the sum of #4 and #8

The team with the lowest score wins. The team with the lowest score gets a 5pt bonus on the next quiz.
